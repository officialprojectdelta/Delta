# &#916; Cross Compiler (dcc)


A programming language, designed as an alternative to C++, based off of C. This is the compiler for the project.

This branch is old. It was the original branch of this project, which was a very simplistic C compiler. It was generating direct assembly, with little to no optimization. This branch will not be updated.
