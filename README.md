# &#916; Cross Compiler (dcc)


A programming language, designed as an alternative to C++, based off of C. This is the compiler for the project.

This branch was the second idea I had for this project. I was going to write an intermediate representation for the delta project, which would handle all of the optimization, but I eventually realized that I didn't want to reinvent the wheel and just focus on a programming language and use an existing intermediate representation. This branch will also never be used again. However, I may (once the language actually has some features) continue to work on an intermediate language.
