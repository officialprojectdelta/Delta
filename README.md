# &#916; Cross Compiler (dcc)


A programming language, designed as an alternative to C++, based off of C. This is the compiler for the project. This will use (at least for now) the human readable format of llvm ir. This is to make it easier for debugging. Eventually we will either migrate to a custom ir, or the in memory format of the llvm ir.
