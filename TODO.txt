Features that might be nice in the future, but not currently implemented
-Not high up on the list of features

-Add boolean values to literal_cast DONE

Potential Features
Features may or may not be implemented, depending on if they are important enough
-Proper double const pointers (where the pointer to type can be const and the pointer itself can be const)
